COMMANDS                                                       *todo-commands*

`<Leader>-s` : Sort the file

`<Leader>-d` : Insert the current date

`<Leader>-D` : Insert the current date with leading `x` (completed)

`date<tab>` : (Insert mode) Insert the current date

The following mapping require todo.txt support scripts:

`<leader>-S` : Sort the file according to task due date

`<leader>-X` : Mark current task as completed

`<leader>-P` : Postpone current task

`<leader>-C` : Update task due date if task is recurrent. Otherwise mark it as completed

`<leader>-t` : Mark task as due today

All these commands assume, that task due date is specified as `due:yyyy-mm-dd` and task recurrent interval
is specified as `rec:[0-9]+[dwmy]`

<Leader> is \ by default, so <Leader>-s means you type \s
